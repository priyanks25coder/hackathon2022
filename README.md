# Hackathon-2022

## Problem Statement:
As a hiring manager, it can be annoying to search LinkedIn and GitHub accounts while looking for talent. Present an idea that makes finding developers easier for hiring managers.

## Pitch (Solution):
HireMe provides a One-Stop solution for Hiring Talent.
It has a very Simple and Beautiful UI divided into appropriate sections to handle all the levels of hiring, Right from the Job creation to the Interview Conducting State of the Candidate.
It also provides a skill-based filtering search that can help to filter candidates based on relevant skills.

A Deep Explanation with visuals is provided in the UI Section.

## Sections of UI
The main sections of the Product are as follows:

- **Dashboard**
    - It provides the overall outlook of the recruitment process.
    - Summaries of each section such as no of joining candidates, number of vacancies for a job, the candidates currently in progress, etc are provided in the dashboard.

- **Job Section**
    - This section provides a clear vision of the number of jobs in which hiring is going on along with its detail. Also, jobs can be added or removed.
    - It provides a complete list of candidates that have applied with their information(Position, Resume, Phone, and Email).
    - An accept/reject button is provided to Hiring Managers/Recuitrires to accept/reject candidates based on their Resume and skills.

- **Task Section**
    - In this section, a task can be added to a particular job that candidates need to attempt.
    - The candidate's uploaded solution is also available on this screen. Once the team decides to go ahead with the candidate, they can Accept/Reject the candidate. 
    - If the candidate is accepted an interview link is created and shared with the candidate.

- **Analytics Section**
    - This section can help in understanding various charts and graphs on our hiring process.
    - It can help in analyzing data such as (Reason of Rejection, Rejection vs No of Candidates Placed, Analysing the Social Platforms where candidates have applied, etc.)

- **Message Section**
    - This section provides the ability to communicate with the candidates. In this way, it is a one-stop solution for managers to communicate and update candidates about their progress.

- **Settings Section**
    - In this section, HM can set up thier profile and toggle some settings such as notification, theme settings.

## Backend Solution: (Search)
- We are using NodeJs on the Backend along with HyperDb as a Database. In this, we have implemented a search filter that is based on the skills of the candidate.
- The search can be seen in the UI prototype at the top.

### Search Example:

Search Example 1: ```In this example we are searching based on First Name as well as Skill```
